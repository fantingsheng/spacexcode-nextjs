My site is a place to learn and try new tech, so after seeing Lee Robinsons post on [Using the Spotify API with Next.js](https://leerob.io/blog/spotify-api-nextjs) this 
was definitely something I wanted to try out. The goal was to add a "Now playing" widget to the footer showing what I'm currently listening to on Spotify.

A few years back I purchased the first version of  Apple Watch, and I remember that the "Now playing" complication had a very pleasant animation with "bars" jumping
 up and down. This tutorial shows how to create a similar animation perfect for visualizing music. This is what we're building: (psst, if I'm listening to music right 
 now you can watch a live example in the footer…)

```js
function main() {
  return 1 + 2
}
```
